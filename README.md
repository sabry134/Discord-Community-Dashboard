# Discord Oauth setup

## Overview

To integrate Discord OAuth into your application, follow these steps to create an application in the Discord Developer Portal and obtain your credentials.

## Step 1: Create a Discord Application

1. **Go to the Discord Developer Portal**: Visit [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. **Log In**: Sign in with your Discord account.
3. **Create a New Application**:
   - Click on the "New Application" button.
   - Enter a name for your application and click "Create".

## Step 2: Set Up OAuth2

1. **Navigate to the OAuth2 Tab**:
   - Select your application from the list.
   - Click on the "OAuth2" tab in the left sidebar.
   
2. **Configure OAuth2 Settings**:
   - **Redirects**: Under "Redirects," add your redirect URI. This should be your backend endpoint that handles the OAuth callback (e.g., `http://localhost:8081/discord-oauth-callback`).
   - **Scopes**: Select the scopes your application requires. For basic user authentication, select:
     - `identify`
     - `join`
   - **Bot**: If your application requires bot functionality, you can also generate a bot token under the "Bot" tab.

3. **Generate the OAuth2 URL**:
   - Scroll down to "OAuth2 URL Generator."
   - Select the scopes you configured earlier.
   - Copy the generated URL.

## Step 3: Set Up Your `.env` File

Add the following lines to your `.env` file in the `discord_community_server` directory, filling in the placeholders with your application's values:

```env
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
DISCORD_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8081/discord-oauth-callback
```

# MongoDB Database Setup

To set up a MongoDB database, follow these steps:

- Create an Account on MongoDB Atlas: Go to MongoDB Atlas and sign up for an account.
- Create a New Cluster: After logging in, click on "Build a Cluster" and follow the prompts to create a new cluster.
- Connect to Your Cluster: Once your cluster is created, click on "Connect" and follow the instructions to add your IP address and create a database user.
